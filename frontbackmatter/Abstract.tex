\chapter*{Abstract}
Business Processes have become an essential tool in organizing, documenting and executing company workflows while Event Processing can be used as a powerful tool to increase their flexibility especially in destributed scenarios. 
The publish-subscribe paradigm is commonly used when communicating with complex event processing platforms, nevertheless prominent process modelling notations do not specify how to handle event subscription.

At the example of BPMN 2.0, the first part of this work illustrates the need for a flexible usage of event subscription in process models and derives new requirements for process modelling notations. An assessment of the coverage of these requirements in BPMN 2.0 is presented and shortcomings are pointed out.

Based on the identified requirements, this work presents a new concept for handling event subscription in business process management solutions, predominantly built on the notion of event buffers. The concept includes an extension to the BPMN meta model, specifies the semantics and API of a new event buffering module and describes the changes necessary to the behaviour of the process engine.

For evaluation purposes, the concept has been implemented as a reusable Camunda Process Engine Plugin that interacts with the academic Complex Event Processing Platform UNICORN.
