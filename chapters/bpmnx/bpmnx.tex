Present an abstract framework for flexible event subscription.

> How does event subscription currently affect the workflow?

To fulfill requirements R1.1 and R1.2, additional information has to be included in the BPMN model. By default, a BPMN intermediate event does not have information on the time of subscription or the event query. 
The BPMN specification offers BPMN-X extensions to add custom properties or elements to a model.

To accomodate the required information, the following extension is proposed:
> The extension should apply to MessageIntermediateCatchEvent and MessageBoundaryEvent
> extend tMessage => tBufferedCEPMessage, so that the messageRef can be reused
> OR extension to messageEventDefinition: ExplicitSubscriptionMessageEventDefinition
> [subscriptionQuery, subscriptionTime, bufferPolicy]

A buffer shared across multiple instances or events is more complex than a simple single-event-buffer (that one does not require buffer policies). As soon as the requestEvent call can be executed multiple times for the same queryId, we need to specify the following aspects:

Buffer policies:
(widely based on [Ref paper Sankalita]) RetrievalPolicy, ConsumptionPolicy, LifetimePolicy
+ buffer maximum age (= combination of lifetime policies)
