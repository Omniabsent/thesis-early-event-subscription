\chapter{Flexible Event Subscription in BPMN}\label{ch:flexibleeventsubscription}
%************************************************

Given the requirements \textit{R1-R3}\,(see~\autoref{ch:requirements},\,p.\,\pageref{ch:requirements}\,ff.) and the shortcomings \textit{S1-S3}\,(see~\autoref{ch:ass:discussion},\,p.\,\pageref{ch:ass:discussion}\,ff.) identified in the previous chapters, this section presents an extension to the BPMN event handling model that allows the flexible use of event subscription mechanisms in business processes.

At first, \ref{ch:bpmnx} describes an extension to the \acf{BPMN}, which aims at providing the Process~Designer with a convenient solution for modeling events that must be obtained through the publish-subscribe interaction pattern.
Afterwards, \autoref{ch:automaticsubscription} clarifies the changes necessary to the event handling platform and the process engine to implement the implicit subscription management required by the BPMN extension.

\section{Conclusions}

\todo[inline]{write chapter conclusions}

an extension involving the message element and a custom task has been introduced.
As the specified execution semantics are not implemented in a standard process engine / event engine, the necessary changes to them have been explained.
the subscription engine must manage subscription and unsubscription at certain points during execution
the event handling module must offer an extended api and an underlying buffering mechanism
