- at first: why is the first area related?

Both topics, \ac{CEP} and \ac{BPM}, have a long history in research.
Bringing the two areas together to empower and improve automated process management


This work has investigated how a flexible event subscription handling can be incorporated in BPMN models.
It is therefor contributing towards a facilitation 

roughly: event-driven business process management (anything that correlates bpm and cep)

Research in the area of event-driven business process management has been undertaken for several years now.



\cite{Pufahl2017} makes use of events to control process executions and considers event subscription as an essential step in the process. However, the subscription time cannot be chosen flexibly.

\cite{mandal:2017} has been the starting point for this thesis, not only acknowledging the discrepancy between the event occurrence time in the real world and the event subscription time as interpreted from the BPMN standard, but also incorporating event subscription in the BPMN model.
Inspired by their work, this thesis revisits the topic from scratch
however: 

\cite{Cabanillas2014}: investigations on the connection between events and process models, leading to \cite{Baumgrass2016}: extension of bpmn for receiving events, process variables in the query

similar to chapter 4:

\cite{von2010integrating}: Integrating Complex Events for Collaborating and Dynamically Changing Business Processes; talk about un/subscription, extend ws-bpel with subscription, reporting, patterns, expression language, ..; scope, time of subscription and event buffering not discussed

%WSDL and BPEL extensions for Event Driven Architecture: extensions to specify event format, producer or consumer, mention subscription etc, I think only inter- and intra-process communication, no external events

\cite{appel2014modeling}: includes the streams and stream processing right into the process model
