The field of \ac{EdBPM} has developed from connecting \ac{CEP} and \ac{BPM} in an attempt to increase the quality and performance of business processes.
\acs{EdBPM} must be viewed from different perspectives.
In event-driven business process monitoring and business activity monitoring, the process engine is solely an event producer that publishes information to an event engine.
A considerable amount of research was undertaken to make use of CEP to detect process violations and execution performance.

This work has investigated how a flexible event subscription handling can be incorporated in BPMN models.
It is therefor contributing towards a facilitation 

roughly: event-driven business process management (anything that correlates bpm and cep)

Research in the area of event-driven business process management has been undertaken for several years now.



\cite{Pufahl2017} makes use of events to control process executions and considers event subscription as an essential step in the process. However, the subscription time cannot be chosen flexibly.

\cite{mandal:2017} has been the starting point for this thesis, not only acknowledging the discrepancy between the event occurrence time in the real world and the event subscription time as interpreted from the BPMN standard, but also incorporating event subscription in the BPMN model.
Inspired by their work, this thesis revisits the topic from scratch
however: 

\cite{Cabanillas2014}: investigations on the connection between events and process models, leading to \cite{Baumgrass2016}: extension of bpmn for receiving events, process variables in the query

similar to chapter 4:
%Control the flow: How to safely compose streaming services into business processes
%Modeling and Execution of Event Stream Processing in Business Processes
\cite{appel2014modeling}: includes the streams and stream processing right into the process model
same: \cite{biornstad2006control}
