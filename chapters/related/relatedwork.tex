Research in the area of event-driven business process management has been undertaken for several years now.
The field of \acf{EdBPM} has developed from connecting \ac{CEP} and \ac{BPM} in an attempt to increase the quality and performance of business processes.
\acs{EdBPM} must be viewed from different perspectives.

%Event-based monitoring of process execution violations

In event-driven business process monitoring and business activity monitoring, the process engine is solely an event producer that publishes information to an event engine.
A considerable amount of research was undertaken to make use of CEP to detect process violations and execution performance.

This work has investigated how a flexible event subscription handling can be incorporated in BPMN models.

%Control the flow: How to safely compose streaming services into business processes
%Modeling and Execution of Event Stream Processing in Business Processes
\cite{appel2014modeling}: includes the streams and stream processing right into the process model
same: \cite{biornstad2006control}

Event subscription is done to enable \ac{EdBPC}.
in edbpc, the business process takes the role of an event consumer.

\cite{Cabanillas2014}: investigations on the connection between events and process models, leading to \cite{Baumgrass2016}: extension of bpmn for receiving events, process variables in the query

\cite{Pufahl2017} makes use of events to control process executions and considers event subscription as an essential step in the process. However, the subscription time cannot be chosen flexibly.
\cite{decker2008instantiation}: Process Instantiation, talks a lot about subscription, but no flexible subscr time, nobuffer, only for instantiation
- maybe ref Barros, A., Decker, G., Grosskopf, A.: Complex events in business processes. In: Business Information Systems. Springer (2007), for example in pub/sub principle > temporal order (like mandal et al)


\cite{von2010integrating}: Integrating Complex Events for Collaborating and Dynamically Changing Business Processes; talk about un/subscription, extend ws-bpel with subscription, reporting, patterns, expression language, ..; scope, time of subscription and event buffering not discussed
also: \cite{juric2010wsdl}

\cite{mandal:2017} has been the starting point for this thesis, not only acknowledging the discrepancy between the event occurrence time in the real world and the event subscription time as interpreted from the BPMN standard, but also incorporating event subscription in the BPMN model.
Inspired by their work, this thesis revisits the topic from scratch
however: ...

- use case implementations
\cite{estruch2012event}: event-driven manufacturing process; 

- to enable flexible event subscription in bpmn models, we have presented a bpmn extension in accordance with the in-built bpmn extension mechanism
> BPMN extension mechanisms: braun2014classification (most of the extensions are not model conform), braun2015behind (implicit and explicit extension)
> also mandal
> extension for monitoring


- in this thesis, the queries must be formulated in complete epl. some related work argues that this is too difficult.
\cite{Kunz2010}: acknowledge the lack of usability in CEP and address it by applying bpmn as graphical support for the definition of cep patterns
\cite{gabriel2016konzeptionelle}: generate queries from new graphical notation, anbieterunabhÃ¤ngige Modellierung von EdBPM



- maybe: persisting events in cep platforms | or delayed delivery of events | 
to implement a flexible event subscription time, is has been noted that a temporary storage is required. Seen from the time of consumption, historic events are consumed.

> \cite{roth2010event}: Event data warehousing for complex event processing and \cite{buchmann2010event}:Event-Driven services: Integrating production, logistics and transportation
also \cite{li2007historic}: historic data in pub/sub
> but if i want to have that historic information, than I would have to issue a subscription some time before. I integrate everything in the process model

- event buffering for the application in a BPM environment may not be confused with internal buffering techniques used within event engines to perform load shedding, even out short term load peaks.
