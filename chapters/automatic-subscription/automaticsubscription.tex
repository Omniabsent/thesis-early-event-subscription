\section{Buffered Event Handling}
Why do we need a buffer to allow early event subscription?

What is the desired functionality of the event buffer? What functionality (API) does it expose?
> this could be seen as an extension to the API that is exposed by a standard CEP Platform
> standard platform API: registerQuery(queryString, notificationRecipient) : queryId, deleteQuery(queryId)
> extended API: registerQuery(queryString): queryId, requestEvent(queryId, notificationRecipient), unsubscribe(queryId), deleteQuery(queryId)




\section{Extended Process Engine Behaviour}
=> As a link between the BPMN model and the Buffered Event handling

\todo[inline]{there must be a "subscription-garbage-collection" for any events that cannot be reached anymore in the current process execution! e.g. two different events behind an xor-gateway. the garbage collection could be executed on every transition}
